Today, the most common meaning is \"empty hand\" (空手), and <b>Karate-do</b> translates as \"the way of the empty hand\". It is believed that the art is a fusion of Chinese fighting techniques, brought to Okinawa by merchants, with the native fighting art of Okinawa, known as <b>Te</b> (hand).",

Karate was popularized and introduced in high schools before World War II.",
      "transition": "Like many Japanese martial arts, Karate made its transition to <b>Karate-do</b> in the early 20th century. The \"do\" (way) imbues the practice with elements of Zen Buddhism, sometimes called \"Zen in motion\". Modernization also included the adoption of the white uniform (<b>keikogi</b>) and colored belts to indicate rank, both popularized by Jigoro Kano, the founder of Judo."
